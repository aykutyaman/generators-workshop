Exercise 0: Run to Completion
=====================================
In JS once a function starts executing, it runs until it completes(run-to-completion). But ES6 introduces a new type that does not behave with the run-to-completion behavior. This new type of function is called a "generator".

A generator is a special kind of function that can start and stop one or more times,  and doesn't necessarily ever have to finish.
